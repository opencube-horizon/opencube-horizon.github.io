The overall of vision of the **OpenCUBE** project is to design, implement and validate a full-stack solution of a European Cloud computing blueprint that will be: 
- i) deployed on European hardware infrastructure, 
- ii) targeted for industrial and consumer cloud workloads, 
- iii) tunable for the requirements of the whole computing continuum, from edge to cloud and HPC, 
- iv) enable energy-awareness at all levels, and v) built on industry standard open APIs using Open Source components.

In more details, the specific goals of the OpenCUBE project are the following:
- **Objective I**: Design and deploy a hardware platform capable of hosting EPI processor and accelerator and factoring into the requirements of representative cloud workloads

- **Objective II**: Design and deliver a full software stack that enables the initialization of cloud servers on the EPI-based platform

- **Objective III**: Enable system-wide efficiency through heterogeneous data centre architecture and eased programmability of heterogeneous resources.

- **Objective IV**: Fully test and validate the deployed stack with a diverse set of applications including cloud-native, HPC, and emerging coupled workflows to run the deployed stack
